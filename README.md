# SDON
The survivability- and latency-constrained software-defined optical network (SDON) makes use of multiple loop-free paths to jointly calculate network failure probability, which greatly improves the networkâ€™s survivability.

Taking latency constraints into account, the most suitable controller deployment node is selected. 

Paper_3 refers to the algorithm proposed in this work for SDON, and the algorithms of paper_1/2/4 are used for comparison.
